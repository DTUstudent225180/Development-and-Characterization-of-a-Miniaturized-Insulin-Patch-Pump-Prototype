# Micropump-Based Patch Device: Data Analysis Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts developed for a bachelor-level engineering thesis focused on the characterization of a compact, low-power microfluidic pumping system for patch-based drug delivery applications.

The scripts support the analysis of fluid flow, pressure generation, and electrical behavior, based on experimental data gathered from multiple design iterations.

### `03-06-2025-1338_flow_and_pressure_analysis.py`
Primary script for analyzing flow rate and pressure data obtained from frequency sweep experiments. Outputs include smoothed curves, peak detection, and summarized performance metrics.

### `04-06-2025-2255_correlation_pressure_flow-copy.py`
Used to correlate flow and pressure data across test runs. Helps reveal behavioral dependencies between operating frequency and system response.

### `05-05-2025-1624_I_RMS_file_generator-copy.py`
Script for calculating RMS current values from oscilloscope trace data. These metrics are used for estimating electrical energy consumption during actuation.

### `27-05-2025-0041_configuration_comparison-copy.py`
Comparison suite for evaluating multiple prototype configurations across common test parameters. Enables overlay plotting and batch metric analysis.

### `RMS_current_plot_and_more-copy.py`
Includes visualization tools for current trace analysis, frequency response overlays, and interactive comparison between configurations or test conditions.

## ðŸ§ª Experimental Context

All scripts were developed for post-processing data from physical experiments involving a miniaturized diaphragm-based pumping mechanism integrated into a wearable patch format. 

Measurements were taken under laboratory conditions using water as a test fluid (due to its similar viscosity to the target application medium). The tests were conducted in a controlled benchtop environment without biological material.

## ðŸ§  Use of Generative AI

Generative AI tools were employed throughout the project for:

- Code generation and debugging
- Exploratory data visualization ideas
- Grammar optimization and language refinement in written documentation

## ðŸ“˜ Academic Context

These scripts were developed as part of an engineering bachelor thesis at a European technical university. The focus was on early-stage prototyping and experimental validation of compact fluidic actuation systems.
